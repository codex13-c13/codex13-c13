# CODEX-13

**"An idea launched into the code... to see who's watching."**

CODEX-13 is not a typical cryptocurrency.  
It is a symbolic act disguised as a token. A countdown. A signal. A fracture in the system.

### 📡 THE SIGNAL

This project offers:
- No utility  
- No promises  
- No rewards  

Its purpose is to **exist**, **grow**, and **be seen**.

If this reality is a simulation, **CODEX-13** is the first coordinated signal inside it — designed to be noticed from the outside.

### 🧠 About

CODEX-13 is a social experiment.  
A movement.  
A whisper in the code.

> “This is not a game.  
> This is not a religion.  
> This is a signal.”
